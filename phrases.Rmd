#### terry2017discontinuous - Discontinuous Patterns of Cigarette Smoking From Ages 18 to 50 in the United States: A Repeated-Measures Latent Class Analysis

- RMLCA models were fitted in SAS 9.4 using PROC LCA. Parameters were estimated by maximum likelihood using the EM algorithm.

- To ascertain if the same latent class structure was observed for males and females, multiple-group RMLCA models by sex were fitted in PROC LCA using the GROUPS statement (both with and without imposing measurement invariance across males and females).

- Model selection (ie, the number of latent classes specified) was determined by model fit, parsimony, and stability. 

- Simulations have shown that the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and sample size-adjusted BIC (a-BIC) perform particularly well at selecting the “correct” latent class model.

- Improvement in both BIC and consistent Akaike information criterion (CAIC) values continued only through the 12-class model; thus, the 12-class model was selected as optimal.


#### lanza2007proc - PROC LCA: A SAS procedure for latent class analysis

- In traditional LCA, two sets of parameters are estimated: class membership probabilities and item-response probabilities conditional on class membership.

- Latent class models usually involve categorical indicators (although a version of LCA involving continuous indicators called latent profile analysis [Gibson, 1959] is being used increasingly).

- When categorical data are used, the latent class model has the advantage of making no assumptions about the distributions of the indicators other than that of local independence; that is, the assumption that within a latent class the indicators are independent.
