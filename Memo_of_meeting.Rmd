**Attendees:** Professor Luigi Palla, Dr. Suzana Almoosawi, Chaochen Wang

**Notekeeper:** Chaochen Wang

**Main Topic:** how to define an eating occasion specifically for carbohydrate intake or what approaches can we use to analysis the eating time pattern of carbohydrate. 

- From Professor Luigi: 
    - We may use gram consumed per hour; 
    - Percentage of energy from carbohydrate per eating occasion (we already know that the cut-off value for energy eating occasion is defined as $\geqslant$ 210 kJ); 
    - Or is there any definition of eating time window block? (For total energy intake we used 15 minutes).
    
- From Dr. Suzana: 
    - According to the guideline (which?), it is suggested that the distribution of carbohydrate intake should be equal for breakfast (25%), lunch (25%), dinner (25%), and snacks (25%). Therefore, the recommendation is 270 g/day (for both men and women?) which lead to 67.5 gram per meal.
    - Or if we consider the composition of energy sources, it is also recommended that 25% of the total energy should come from carbohydrates.
    - We may also use the ratio of carbohydrates and (for example) fibre: 1 g fibre/ 10 g carbohydrates.
    - In the NDNS survey, they already defined 7 meal blocks: 
        - breakfast (6 am to 9 am); 
        - mid-morning snack (9 am to 12 noon); 
        - lunch (12 noon to 2 pm); 
        - afternoon snack (2 pm to 5 pm); 
        - dinner (5 pm to 8 pm); 
        - late-night snack (8 pm to 10 pm); 
        - midnight snack (10 pm to 6 am).
    - Use the already defined 7 meal blocks will be easier in terms of comparing with existing publications from NDNS data.
    
- From Professor Luigi: 
    - Can we use 1 hour window for each participant? So each person will have 24 time sequence of eating (carbohydrates) per day. 
    - **We may calculate the energy consumption per hour for each participant. And also calculate the percentage of energy that come from carbohydrate each hour. Would that be sensible?**
    - What cut-off would be appropriate to say that within that specific hour, the consumption of carbohydrates would be good or bad?
    - **Just to add that if there is a concern that too few people would have consumed CH for example at night then we can collapse the hours at night into one class as we did with Raoul, say from 11pm till 5am or from 12 till 6am.**
    
- From Dr. Suzana: 
    - Probably, this could be an option. Usually, a food product/meal can be categorised as with low carbohydrates or sugar condensed if the contribution of energy from carbohydrates in that food/meal is lower than 25% or higher than 70%: 
        - if 25% energy from carbohydrates $\Rightarrow$ low-carbohydrates; 
        - if 70% energy from carbohydrates $\Rightarrow$ high-carbohydrates; 
        - if 26% ~ 69% energy from carbohydrates $\Rightarrow$ medium-carbohydrates.
    - But if we need to dichotomise, I need to confirm again whether there is any evidence/suggestion about that.
    - Still, this could the first step of our analysis. The second step we may think about is the quality (ratio) between different subtypes of carbohydrates within the hour.
