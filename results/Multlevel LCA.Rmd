# What was not correct before?

When I am trying to write down the statistical details of multilevel LCA in `PROC LCA`, I found an important information that actually make me feel all the analyses about mixed effect LCA [we have been conducting previously](http://rpubs.com/winterwang/MixedLCA) were somehow misleading. 

In the [`PROC LCA` user's guideline (https://methodology.psu.edu/sites/default/files/software/proclcalta/proc_lca_lta_1-3-2-1_users_guide.pdf)](https://methodology.psu.edu/sites/default/files/software/proclcalta/proc_lca_lta_1-3-2-1_users_guide.pdf), if you go to Page 10, last sentence of the top paragraph. It says **"Clustering is ignored for estimation purposes, but is taken into account in calculating standard errors by using a 'robust' or 'sandwich' style covariance estimate."** Which contradicts with what was described in page 21 about the function of `CLUSTER` option: **"This statement tells `PROC LCA` that the subjects are not independent random draws, but are nested within clusters such as schools or classrooms..."** 

Therefore, I ran two SAS `PROC LCA` programmes (one with the `CLUSTER ID` option, one without) and compared the outputs from the two programmes. If the data structure was considered properly, the two programmes should have given me two different estimates. However, it turned out that **they produced identical parameter estimates**. This meant that the clustered data structure was ignored in `SAS`, even if we used the `CLUSTER ID` statement, the observations were considered as independent in the previous calculations. I was really disappointed, and sincerely sorry about that. But they were not in vain, because when digging into the methodology, conducting LCA by ingoring the data structure should be the first step when someone perform a Multilevel LCA.

# What should I have done? 

According to a multilevel LCA (MLCA) example paper: [Multilevel latent class analysis: An application of adolescent smoking typologies with individual and contextual predictors](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10705511003659342): 

**"MLCA accounts for the nested structure of the data by allowing latent class intercepts to vary across Level 2 units and thereby examining if and how Level 2 units influence the Level 1 latent classes. These random intercepts allow the probability of membership in a particular Level 1 latent class to vary across Level 2 units (e.g., communities)."**

In their article, they wanted to identify the smoking pattern for individuals while the individuals were nested within the communities. So they applied MLCA to identify smoking pattern for their study sample, and then within the MLCA framework, communities were also classified by the patterns of smokers within the community:

This gave me an idea of "how to deal with the non-consistent eaters problem" that we were concerning about. Because we don't need to. A proper MLCA does it for us. 

In MLCA, separate latent class models are specified for level 1 (in NDNS data, the observations) and level 2 (in NDNS data, the individuals). So our data from NDNS actually provided valuable data about how adults in the UK eat throughout the day for 4 days. We can use the data to capture the carbohydrates (or whatever else we are interested) eating time patterns from these observations, and then based on the carb eating patterns calculated by the model, people that eated similar across four days should be regrouped. So there should be two-steps of regrouping. 

# An example that examined 3 level 1 classes and 2 level 2 classes in the NDNS data

I have done a MLCA that specified 3 latent classes in level 1 (observations) and two latent classes in level 2 (individuals) using Mplus 7.4, and the summary of analysis as well as the results are shown below: 

1. In this analysis, carbohydrates intake was defined as: 
    - not eating; 
    - eating and carbohydrates contributed less than 50% of energy;
    - eating and carbohydrates contributed higher or equal to 50% of energy.
    
2. Level 1 latent classes are called **within classes (CW)**, level 2 latent classes are called **between classes (CB)**; 

3. Univariate proportions and counts for the responses about carborhydrates consumption: (Note that H0-H23 indicate the hour of the day)

So, if what we have defined in the level 1 classes are correct then in the individual level, there are two types of people, class 1 and class 2. Individuals in class 1 have about evenly distributed probabilities of carbohydrate eating pattern, while individuals in class 2 have very low possiblity (4.9%) of eating a big breakfast.

## Latent Classes patterns estimated by the model

Where: 

- **CB**: Between individual (level 2) latent classes;
- **CW**: Observational latent classes (level 1);
- **LCpattern**: Latent Class Pattern defined as:

```  
  Latent Class         CB        CW
   Pattern No.      Class     Class

         1             1         1
         2             1         2
         3             1         3
         4             2         1
         5             2         2
         6             2         3
```

```{r echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
