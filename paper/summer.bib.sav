	Abstract = {We have developed an enhanced Littrow configuration extended cavity diode laser (ECDL) that can be tuned without changing the direction of the output beam. The output of a conventional Littrow ECDL is reflected from a plane mirror fixed parallel to the tuning diffraction grating. Using a free-space Michelson wavemeter to measure the laser wavelength, we can tune the laser over a range greater than 10 nm without any alteration of alignment.},

	Abstract = {Operating a laser diode in an extended cavity which provides frequency-selective feedback is a very effective method of reducing the laser's linewidth and improving its tunability. We have developed an extremely simple laser of this type, built from inexpensive commercial components with only a few minor modifications. A 780~nm laser built to this design has an output power of 80~mW, a linewidth of 350~kHz, and it has been continuously locked to a Doppler-free rubidium transition for several days.},

Parametric and nonparametric random–coefficient LC models are proposed here, which will make it possible to modify this assumption. For example, the models can be used for the analysis of data collected with complex sampling designs, data with a multilevel structure, and multiple–group data for more than a few groups. An adapted EM algorithm is presented that makes maximum–likelihood estimation feasible. The new model is illustrated with examples from organizational, educational, and cross–national comparative research.},
